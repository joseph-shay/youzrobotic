Below is a breakdown of the logic used and why it’s effective.\nHow the code works : Step 1: Reading the Data from the BNO055 The BNO055 provides orientation data in degrees, specifically yaw, pitch, and roll. For turning, we focus on the yaw angle (rotation around the vertical axis). Each reading gives an absolute orientation between 0° and 360°:\nsensors_event_t event; bno.getEvent(\u0026amp;event); // Read the BNO055 sensor data float currentAngle = event.orientation.x; // Extract the yaw angle This yaw value is essential for tracking how far the robot has turned.\nStep 2: Storing the Start Angle When the turn begins, the robot records the current yaw angle as the starting point. This serves as a reference for calculating how much the robot has turned:\nfloat startAngle = event.orientation.x; // Store the starting angle Step 3: Calculating the Turn Angle To determine the robot’s progress, we calculate the difference between the current yaw angle and the starting angle. Since the yaw angle wraps around at 360°, we adjust the difference for continuity:\nangleDiff = isRightTurn ? (currentAngle - startAngle) : (startAngle - currentAngle); if (angleDiff \u0026gt; 180) angleDiff -= 360; if (angleDiff \u0026lt; -180) angleDiff += 360; This ensures that the angular difference is always in the range of -180° to 180°, allowing for smooth calculations regardless of the robot’s heading.\nStep 4: Dynamic Speed Adjustment To avoid overshooting the target and minimize torque near the end of the turn, the robot dynamically adjusts motor speed based on the remaining angle to the target (90°):\nfloat remainingAngle = 90 - abs(angleDiff); int speed = map(remainingAngle, 0, SLOWDOWN_RANGE, MIN_SPEED, MAX_SPEED); speed = constrain(speed, MIN_SPEED, MAX_SPEED); Remaining Angle: The closer the robot gets to 90°, the smaller this value becomes. map() Function: Converts the remaining angle into a proportional motor speed. Speed Constraints: Ensures the motor speed stays within defined minimum (MIN_SPEED) and maximum (MAX_SPEED) limits. This approach results in high speed when far from the target and gradual deceleration as the robot approaches the 90° mark.\nStep 5: Controlling the Motors The motor speeds are applied based on the direction of the turn:\nFor a right turn, one side spins forward while the other spins backward. For a left turn, the directions are reversed. int s1 = direction * speed; int s2 = direction * speed; controlServos(s1, s2, s1, s2); Step 6: Stopping and Reducing Torque Once the robot completes the 90° turn, the motors are stopped by setting their speed to 0. To prevent the servos from applying unnecessary holding torque (which can cause hissing sounds and strain), the torque is disabled:\ncontrolServos(0, 0, 0, 0); // Stop servos for (int id = ServoID1; id \u0026lt;= ServoID4; id++) { sts3032.EnableTorque(id, 0); // Disable torque } This not only ensures smooth operation but also protects the motors and components from excessive stress.\nWhy This Method Works Accuracy: The BNO055’s absolute orientation readings ensure precise tracking of the robot’s position. Efficiency: Dynamic speed adjustment minimizes overshooting and unnecessary strain on the motors. Longevity: Disabling torque after stopping reduces wear on the servos and eliminates unwanted noise. Key Parameters SLOWDOWN_RANGE: Defines the angular range within which the robot begins to decelerate (e.g., 30°). MIN_SPEED and MAX_SPEED: Define the minimum and maximum motor speeds, which can be tuned based on your robot’s motor characteristics. This implementation ensures smooth and precise 90-degree turns, making it ideal for robotics applications requiring accurate movements.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how to achieve this using Python and the powerful word2number library. By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to implement a simple function to handle such conversions in your projects.\nThe Solution The word2number library simplifies the process of converting number words into integers. Let’s dive straight into the implementation.\nStep 1: Install the word2number Library Before we begin, ensure you have the library installed. You can do this using pip:\npip install word2number Step 2: Write the Conversion Function Here’s a Python function that takes a string input and returns the corresponding number, formatted with commas for readability:\nfrom word2number import w2n def string_to_number(input_string): try: number = w2n.word_to_num(input_string) formatted_number = f\u0026#34;{number:,}\u0026#34; return formatted_number except ValueError as e: return f\u0026#34;Error: {e}. Make sure the input string is a valid number.\u0026#34; while True: input_string = input(\u0026#34;Enter string (type \u0026#39;close\u0026#39; to exit): \u0026#34;) if input_string.lower() == \u0026#34;close\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Exiting program...\u0026#34;) break output = string_to_number(input_string) print(f\u0026#34;Input: {input_string}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Output: {output}\u0026#34;) Step 3: Test the Function Let’s see the function in action. For the input \u0026ldquo;Three hundred million\u0026rdquo;, the output will be:\nInput: Three hundred million Output: 300,000,000 How It Works Let’s break down the code step by step:\nImporting the Required Library from word2number import w2n This line imports the w2n module from the word2number library, which provides the functionality to convert words into numbers.\nDefining the Function def string_to_number(input_string): This defines a function named string_to_number that takes a single argument input_string, which is expected to be a string containing a number written in words.\nTry Block: Conversion and Formatting try: number = w2n.word_to_num(input_string) formatted_number = f\u0026#34;{number:,}\u0026#34; return formatted_number w2n.word_to_num(input_string): This converts the input string (e.g., \u0026ldquo;three hundred\u0026rdquo;) into an integer (e.g., 300). f\u0026quot;{number:,}\u0026quot;: Formats the resulting number with commas for readability (e.g., 300000 becomes 300,000). return formatted_number: Returns the formatted number as a string. Handling Invalid Input except ValueError as e: return f\u0026#34;Error: {e}. Make sure the input string is a valid number.\u0026#34; If the input string cannot be interpreted as a number, the w2n.word_to_num() function raises a ValueError. The except block catches this error and returns a friendly error message indicating the issue. Infinite Loop for User Input while True: input_string = input(\u0026#34;Enter string (type \u0026#39;close\u0026#39; to exit): \u0026#34;) This creates an infinite loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they decide to exit. Exit Condition if input_string.lower() == \u0026#34;close\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Exiting program...\u0026#34;) break Converts the input to lowercase using input_string.lower() and checks if it equals \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo;. If true, the program prints an exit message and breaks the loop. Processing the Input output = string_to_number(input_string) print(f\u0026#34;Input: {input_string}\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;Output: {output}\u0026#34;) Calls the string_to_number() function with the user’s input. Prints both the original input and the function’s output (formatted number or error message). Final Thoughts Converting words to numbers doesn’t have to be complicated. With Python’s word2number library, you can implement a robust solution in just a few lines of code. This function is perfect for applications in data processing, user input handling, or any scenario requiring natural language number conversion.\nFeel free to adapt this function to suit your specific needs, and don’t forget to test it with various inputs to ensure reliability.

Kurt Cobain, the band’s lead vocalist and guitarist, met bassist Krist Novoselic through their shared love of punk rock. After cycling through several drummers, the band finally solidified its lineup with Dave Grohl in 1990, whose powerful drumming became a key part of their sound.\nThe band’s early years were spent crafting their identity in the Pacific Northwest’s burgeoning grunge scene. Influenced by punk, heavy metal, and indie rock, Nirvana’s music fused raw emotion with melodic hooks, creating something entirely unique. Their first album, Bleach (1989), was released under the independent label Sub Pop and showcased their early sound—heavy, gritty, and unapologetically raw.\nThe Breakthrough: Nevermind (1991) Everything changed in 1991 with the release of Nevermind. The album’s lead single, “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, became an anthem almost overnight. Its infectious riff, Cobain’s raspy voice, and the accompanying chaotic music video captured the spirit of a generation.\nThe success of Nevermind was unprecedented. It knocked Michael Jackson’s Dangerous off the top of the Billboard 200 and introduced grunge to a mainstream audience. With hits like “Come as You Are”, “Lithium”, and “In Bloom”, the album sold over 30 million copies worldwide. Nirvana had gone from underground heroes to global rockstars.\nThe Height of Fame and In Utero (1993) As Nirvana’s fame skyrocketed, Cobain struggled with the pressures of stardom and his growing status as the voice of Generation X. The band’s third and final studio album, In Utero (1993), was a stark contrast to the polished sound of Nevermind. Produced by Steve Albini, it was darker, more abrasive, and deeply personal. Songs like “Heart-Shaped Box” and “All Apologies” revealed Cobain’s inner turmoil, while tracks like “Rape Me” challenged societal norms.\nDespite its raw sound, In Utero was a critical and commercial success, further cementing Nirvana’s place in music history.\nThe End of Nirvana Tragically, Nirvana’s story came to an abrupt end on April 5, 1994, when Kurt Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home. His death was ruled a suicide, and it marked the end of an era for the band and the grunge movement.\nThe loss of Cobain left a void in the music world, but Nirvana’s legacy only grew in the years that followed. Posthumous releases, including the MTV Unplugged in New York performance, showcased the band’s talent and emotional depth, solidifying their place as one of the most influential bands in rock history.\nLegacy Though their time together was brief, Nirvana’s impact on music and culture is immeasurable. They revolutionized the sound of rock, brought alternative music to the mainstream, and inspired countless artists across genres. Nirvana wasn’t just a band—it was a movement, a voice for the disenfranchised, and a reminder that music could be raw, real, and transformative.\nPrevious\rNextsads\rA Personal Reflection For me, Nirvana represents freedom—the freedom to be flawed, to be vulnerable, to be unapologetically yourself. Listening to their music feels like stepping into a different world, one where pain and beauty coexist in perfect harmony.\nKurt Cobain’s tragic death in 1994 marked the end of an era, but his spirit lives on in every riff, lyric, and fan who refuses to let go of the band’s legacy. Nirvana wasn’t just a band; it was a revolution.\n","date":"16 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/rants/nirvana/","section":"Rants","summary":"Nirvana: A Legacy of Grunge and Raw Emotion.","title":"'One baby to another says I'm lucky to've met you'","type":"rants"},{"content":"","date":"16 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/rants/","section":"Rants","summary":"","title":"Rants","type":"rants"},{"content":"\rProfile I achieved first place in the 2023 RoboCup IranOpen(secondary lightweight soccer) competition in which I was granted the opportunity to compete in Bordeaux France.

Here I will explain how.\nChoosing a Website Builder There are a lot of website builders out there, but the popular options are Blogger, Squarespace, WordPress, and Wix. These are relatively simple to set up and good options if you don’t want to debug or write code.\nWhat I used instead was Hugo, an open-source website builder. Here’s how it works:\nChoose a theme: I used Blowfish because it has a really minimalist look to it.\nRead the documentation on your theme.\nSet up your website how you like it and run it.\nI used an open-source website builder because, although it requires more programming setup, it looks neat. I didn’t have to write any HTML or CSS. That’s all handled by the theme. The setup was mostly reading documentation, adding features, and debugging random problems.\nYou can also build a website from scratch using React or other web development tools. I was too lazy to do this, but if you are interested in web development, that might be fun.\nPublishing The first step is to buy a domain from Cloudflare Domains.\nOnce you have your domain, you can publish your website for free using Cloudflare Pages.\n","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/posts/how-to-blog/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to create a blog website","title":"How to create a blog","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/series/making-a-blog/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Making a Blog","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/sl/series/ustvarjanje-bloga/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Ustvarjanje Bloga","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/fa/series/%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%DA%AF/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"ساخت بلاگ","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/ar/series/%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A9/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"صناعة المدونة","type":"series"},{"content":"For me, the thought of starting a blog wasn’t even on my radar. But here\u0026rsquo;s what changed my mind and why I decided to give it a shot.\nTo Inspire Others Blogs have incredible potential to inspire. Let me break it down.\nInspiration is a mix of two things: witnessing something extraordinary and realizing that you, too, can achieve it.\nI’ve felt this firsthand. At my first RoboCup in 2023, I was amazed by the extraordinary robots we faced. Talking to their creators made me realize that building such amazing machines was within my reach. The same thing happened at my first WRO in 2023—I saw what was possible if I just pushed myself.\nYou don’t always need direct contact with your role models to be inspired by them. The internet is filled with incredible resources.\nFor Recognition A blog can serve as a portfolio—a way to showcase my work for research, career opportunities, or even just to share with friends and family. It’s a window into what I’m building and why it matters.\nTo Share Knowledge During my time building competition robots, I spent countless hours poring over other teams’ blogs, CAD designs, and videos. Those resources were invaluable, helping me learn and grow.\nIsaac Newton famously said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” We all build on the work of those who came before us. But to become a \u0026ldquo;giant\u0026rdquo; yourself, you need to share your knowledge and experiences.\nSomeone once said:\n“An engineer’s work isn’t complete until it’s documented.”\nAnd that stuck with me.\nPassing it On Others\u0026rsquo; websites have helped me a lot, so making my own blog is an attempt to pass it on. Consider making a blog yourself! I’ve written a blog post on how to get started.\n","date":"10 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/rants/why-make-a-blog-page/","section":"Rants","summary":"Here I explain why I started a blog and why you should consider it too.","title":"Why Blog?","type":"rants"},{"content":"","date":"10 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/youzrobotic/ar/series/%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A9/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"إنشاء مدونة","type":"series"},{"content":"\rMy Experience at SNOWA Factories Today I had the incredible opportunity to visit the SNOWA factories to work on automating some of their factory lines. It was a fascinating experience that combined my passion for robotics, engineering, and innovation with real-world problem-solving.\nUnderstanding the Challenge The factory lines at SNOWA are integral to their operations, producing high-quality products efficiently. However, like many modern industries, they faced challenges in optimizing their workflows, reducing human intervention in repetitive tasks, and ensuring consistency in production. My task was to design and implement automation solutions tailored to their unique needs.\nSpecifically, the factories required three types of robots:\nA robot to pack refrigerators.\nA robot to assemble the refrigerators\u0026rsquo; compressors and screw them in place.\nA 9-axis robotic arm for complex tasks requiring high precision and flexibility.\nPlanning the Automation Before diving into the technical aspects, I spent time observing the existing workflows, understanding the machinery, and identifying bottlenecks. This stage was crucial to ensure that the solutions I proposed would seamlessly integrate into their current systems without disrupting operations.\nSome key areas of focus included:\nStreamlining conveyor belt systems to ensure a smoother transition between production stages.\nIntegrating sensors to monitor product quality in real-time.\nDesigning robots with the dexterity and functionality required for specific tasks, such as packing and assembly.\nChallenges and Solutions Every project comes with its own set of challenges. For this one, the key hurdles included:\nEnsuring compatibility between new automation systems and older machinery.\nMinimizing downtime during the installation and testing phases.\nCalibrating sensors and robotic arms to function accurately in the factory environment.\nThrough careful planning, iterative testing, and open communication with the factory teams, these challenges were successfully overcome.\nThe Outcome By the end of the project, the SNOWA factories had more efficient, reliable, and scalable production lines. The automation systems not only enhanced productivity but also allowed the staff to focus on more critical and creative tasks. The robots, in particular, streamlined the packing and assembly processes, while the 9-axis arm opened up possibilities for even more intricate operations in the future.\nLooking Ahead This experience reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of automation. It’s exciting to think about how these advancements can revolutionize industries, improve efficiency, and open doors to new possibilities.\nI’m incredibly grateful to SNOWA for trusting me with this project and for the opportunity to contribute to their innovation journey.

My team and I competed in the RoboMission Senior league. We achieved First Place and earned the Gold medal.\nScenario Our modern-day society relies on container shipments that transport all kinds of goods over the oceans. In the past, particular routes would involve ships having to take long, dangerous journeys around the edges of continents, such as around Cape Horn in South America or the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. But the construction of the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal have made it possible for ships to reach their destinations much faster and more safely. Many modern transport ships have even been built exactly according to the Panamax or the new Neopanamax standard: the maximum size for crossing the Panama Canal.\nStandardization and automation are other aspects that have made international transport over the sea more effective. The introduction of standard shipping containers is an example of this standardization. These containers can easily be transferred from a ship to a truck or a train, making transportation faster. In modern ports, many processes are automated, such as the unloading of containerships and even piloting of ships. Autonomous ships are even something we can expect to see in the near future.\nOn the Senior game field, the robot will help to load and unload ships, fuel them, and pilot them to open sea.\nOur Robot Most of the robots in the WRO competition are made with Lego EV3 Mindstorms, and so was ours.\nSpecs The main processor of our robot was an EV3.
