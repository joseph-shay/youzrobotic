For me, the thought of starting a blog wasn’t even on my radar. But here's what changed my mind and why I decided to give it a shot.

## To Inspire Others
Blogs have incredible potential to inspire. Let me break it down.

Inspiration is a mix of two things: witnessing something extraordinary and realizing that you, too, can achieve it.

I’ve felt this firsthand. At my first RoboCup in 2023, I was amazed by the extraordinary robots we faced. Talking to their creators made me realize that building such amazing machines was within my reach. The same thing happened at my first WRO in 2023—I saw what was possible if I just pushed myself.

You don’t always need direct contact with your role models to be inspired by them. The internet is filled with incredible resources.

## For Recognition
A blog can serve as a portfolio—a way to showcase my work for research, career opportunities, or even just to share with friends and family. It’s a window into what I’m building and why it matters.

## To Share Knowledge
During my time building competition robots, I spent countless hours poring over other teams’ blogs, CAD designs, and videos. Those resources were invaluable, helping me learn and grow.

Isaac Newton famously said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” We all build on the work of those who came before us. But to become a "giant" yourself, you need to share your knowledge and experiences.

Someone once said:

{{< lead >}}
>“An engineer’s work isn’t complete until it’s documented.”
{{< /lead >}}

And that stuck with me.

## Passing it On
Others' websites have helped me a lot, so making my own blog is an attempt to pass it on. Consider making a blog yourself! I’ve written a blog post on how to [get started](/posts/how-to-blog/).
