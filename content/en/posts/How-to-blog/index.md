## Choosing a Website Builder
There are a lot of website builders out there, but the popular options are **Blogger, Squarespace, WordPress, and Wix**. These are relatively simple to set up and good options if you don’t want to debug or write code.

What I used instead was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source website builder. Here’s how it works:

1. [Choose a theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/): I used [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) because it has a really minimalist look to it.

2. Read the [documentation](https://blowfish.page/docs/) on your theme.

3. Set up your website how you like it and run it.

I used an open-source website builder because, although it requires more programming setup, it looks neat. I didn’t have to write any HTML or CSS. That’s all handled by the theme. The setup was mostly reading documentation, adding features, and debugging random problems.

You can also build a website from scratch using React or other web development tools. I was too lazy to do this, but if you are interested in web development, that might be fun.

## Publishing

The first step is to buy a domain from Cloudflare Domains.

Once you have your domain, you can publish your website for free using Cloudflare Pages.
